# Calibration of a (real) Robot
It is a Probabilistic Robotics Project and consist in the calibration of: the kinematic parameters and the sensor positions of a front-rear tricycle-like robot.

### Definition of the problem
The problem is composotite by: a front-rear tricycle-like robot, the encoder ticks, positions of the sensor w.r.t. an external tracking system.
In the following image we can observe the robot rappresentation:

### Dataset
The dataset.txt contains the data that come from the sensor of a real robot:
- first lines: information about the kinematic model of the robot, the kinematic parameters to be estimate, an intial guess of those, the encoder order of the field ticks and their max ranges.
- a record consist in: the time stamp, the reading of the steering encoder, the reading of the traction encoder, the odometry and the position of the sensor.

### Input
- A file containing the encoder ticks of all encoders in the system: absolute on the steer axis and incremental on the steering wheel.
- The positions of the sensor w.r.t. an external tracking system.

### Output
- 2D position of the sensor w.r.t the mobile platform.
- The kinematic parameters: Ksteer, Ktraction, SteerOffset and Baseline.

### How run the code
```shell
octave main.m
```
to observer the robot and sensor trajectories moving set:
```shell
octave main.m on
```

### Methodology
Identify the state space X:
- Qualify the domain
- Find a locally Euclidean parameterization

Identify the measurement space(s) Z:
- Qualify the domain
- Find a locally Euclidean parameterization

Identify the prediction functions h(x)

#### Threshold for estimation process
In the estimation process is used different threshold for x, y, theta and phi. The achieve is skip increments that are too small, because they donâ€™t bring any information to the estimate. The threshold have been chosen after tested different value. The best values achieve the following L2 Norm error results: mean 0.190549, min 0.000000, max 0.306568. Without threshold get: mean 0.265269, min 0.000000, max 0.594321.
