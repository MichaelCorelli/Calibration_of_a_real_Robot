# Calibration of a (real) Robot
It is a Probabilistic Robotics Project and consist in the calibration of: the kinematic parameters and the sensor positions of a front-rear tricycle-like robot.

### Dataset
The dataset.txt contains the data that come from the sensor of a real robot:
- first lines: information about the kinematic model of the robot, the kinematic parameters to be estimate, an intial guess of those, the encoder order of the field ticks and their max ranges.
- a record consist in: the time stamp, the reading of the steering encoder, the reading of the traction encoder, the odometry and the position of the sensor.

### Input
- A file containing the encoder ticks of all encoders in the system: absolute on the steer axis and incremental on the steering wheel.
- The positions of the sensor w.r.t. an external tracking system.

### Output
- 2D position of the sensor w.r.t the mobile platform.
- The kinematic parameters: Ksteer, Ktraction, SteerOffset and Baseline.

### How run the code
```shell
octave main.m
```
to observer the robot and sensor trajectories moving set:
```shell
octave main.m on
```

#### Threshold for estimation process
In the estimation process is used different threshold for x, y, theta and phi. The achieve is skip increments that are too small, because they donâ€™t bring any information to the estimate. The threshold have been chosen after tested different value. The best values achieve the following result for mean error: 0.310960 on x and 0.252648 on y. Without threshold get: 0.316149 on x and 0.255728 on y.
